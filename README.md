This repository contains 3 task of Oasis infobyte Data Science internship.
Each task folder containts all neccessary files of particular project.
I have also included pickle file of trained model which can be directly accessed for prediction of the output.
For Iris flower classification model i have also created a file named "Iris_app.py" which containts the code of Streamlit web app for predictions of flower type.
You can also check Requirement.txt file for checking the Versions of different libraries on which the model have developed.
